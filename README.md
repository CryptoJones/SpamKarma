## SpamKarma

SpamKarma is a utility to go through your Gmail Inbox and respond to senders who are in the blacklist.json file with images form the "PayloadImages" directory.

The "retribution level" is the number of pictures sent per infraction.

What type of images you send the offenders is up to you! ;)
